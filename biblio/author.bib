abstract = {It is well known that the Q function which contains the complete information about the quantum state can be measured in a perfect eight-port homodyne detection scheme. A reconstruction formula for the density matrix elements in the photon number basis from a given Q function based on integrals rather than derivatives of the Q function has been recently derived \[1\]. In this paper we propose alternative schemes to reconstruct the photon statistics and density matrix, respectively, from double homodyne detection measurements. To this end the signal field is first split into two beams by a 50/50 beam splitter. Then the two output beams are directed on separate balanced homodyne detectors and the measured joint quadrature distribution P(x1, x2, $\Theta$1, $\Theta$2) for the quadrature components x1 and x2 belonging to the local oscillator phases $\Theta$1 and $\Theta$2 respectively, is considered. Note, that in our scheme the phases $\Theta$1,2 are adjustable independently from each other. In this sense we generalize the eight-port homodyne detection scheme for measurements of the Q function.},

abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables two remote parties to share encryption keys with security based on the laws of physics. Continuous-variable (CV) QKD with coherent states and coherent detection integrates well with existing telecommunication networks. Thus far, long-distance CV-QKD has only been demonstrated using a highly complex scheme where the local oscillator is transmitted, opening security loopholes for eavesdroppers and limiting potential applications. Here, we report a long-distance CV-QKD experiment with a locally generated local oscillator over a 100-kilometer fiber channel with a total loss of 15.4 decibels. This record-breaking distance is achieved by controlling the phase noise–induced excess noise through a machine learning framework for carrier recovery and optimizing the modulation variance. We implement the full CV-QKD protocol and demonstrate the generation of keys secure against collective attacks in the finite-size regime. Our results mark a substantial milestone for realizing CV quantum access networks with a high loss budget and pave the way for large-scale deployment of secure QKD. Machine learning revolutionizes secure quantum communication, pushing its boundaries to unprecedented frontiers.}

abstract = {We discuss quantum key distribution protocols using quantum continuous variables. We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent to the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the resistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure with high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection.Here, we show that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol, even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in the absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This "virtual" entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.},

  abstract = {A quantum key distribution (QKD) network is an infrastructure that
	allows the realization of the key distribution cryptographic primitive
	over long distances and at high rates with information-theoretic
	security. In this work, we consider QKD networks based on trusted
	repeaters from a topology viewpoint, and present a set of analytical
	models that can be used to optimize the spatial distribution of QKD
	devices and nodes in specific network configurations in order to
	guarantee a certain level of service to network users, at a minimum
	cost. We give details on new methods and original results regarding
	such cost minimization arguments applied to QKD networks. These results
	are likely to become of high importance when the deployment of QKD
	networks will be addressed by future quantum telecommunication operators.
	They will therefore have a strong impact on the design and requirements
	of the next generation of QKD devices.},

	allows information encoded in phase shifts imposed on single-photon-level
	pulses to be accurately read out after transmission over many kilometers
	of uncontrolled fiber. Cooled InGaAs avalanche photodiodes, pulse-biased
	using a special noise canceling circuit, are used to detect single
	1.31-mu m infrared photons with a high efficiency, low dark-count
	rate, and subnanosecond time resolution. A single optical fiber carries
	both the quantum information and precise 1.55-mu m timing pulses
	between the two end stations. Overall synchronization of end-station
	activities, public discussion of basis choices, error correction,
	and privacy amplification have all been implemented over a local
	area network (LAN). The system at present generates ran; error-corrected,
	and privacy-amplified key data at rates of similar to 1000, 600,

  abstract = {We have demonstrated a metropolitan all-pass quantum communication
	network in field fiber for four nodes. Any two nodes of them can
	be connected in the network to perform quantum key distribution (QKD).
	An optical switching module is presented that enables arbitrary 2-connectivity
	among output ports. Integrated QKD terminals are worked out, which
	can operate either as a transmitter, a receiver, or even both at
	the same time. Furthermore, an additional link in another city of
	60 km fiber (up to 130 km) is seamless integrated into this network
	based on a trusted relay architecture. On all the links, we have
	implemented protocol of decoy state scheme. All of necessary electrical
	hardware, synchronization, feedback control, network software, execution
	of QKD protocols are made by tailored designing, which allow a completely
	automatical and stable running. Our system has been put into operation
	in Hefei in August 2009, and publicly demonstrated during an evaluation
	conference on quantum network organized by the Chinese Academy of
	Sciences on August 29, 2009. Real-time voice telephone with one-time
	pad encoding between any two of the five nodes (four all-pass nodes
	plus one additional node through relay) is successfully established
	in the network within 60km.},

  abstract = {Information encoded on individual quanta will play an important role
	in our future lives, much as classically encoded digital information
	does today. Combining quantum information carried by single photons
	with classical signals encoded on strong laser pulses in modern fibre-to-the-home
	(FTTH) networks is a significant challenge, the solution to which
	will facilitate the global distribution of quantum information to
	the home and with it a quantum internet?[1]. In real-world networks,
	spontaneous Raman scattering in the optical fibre would induce crosstalk
	between the high-power classical channels and a single-photon quantum
	channel, such that the latter is unable to operate. Here, we show
	that the integration of quantum and classical information on an FTTH
	network is possible by performing quantum key distribution (QKD)
	on a network while simultaneously transferring realistic levels of
	classical data. Our novel scheme involves synchronously interleaving
	a channel of quantum data with the Raman scattered photons from a
	classical channel, exploiting the periodic minima in the instantaneous
	crosstalk and thereby enabling secure QKD to be performed.},

	multiplexing for optimal transmission and detection of the signal
	and phase reference, and employs sophisticated error-correction codes
	for reconciliation. The security of the system is guaranteed against
	general coherent eavesdropping attacks. The performance of the prototype
	was tested over preinstalled optical fibres as part of a quantum
	cryptography network combining different QKD technologies. The stable
	and automatic operation of the prototype over 57 h yielded an average
	secret key distribution rate of 8 kbit s[?]1 over a 3 dB loss optical
	fibre, including the key extraction process and all quantum and classical
	communication. This system is therefore ideal for securing communications
	in metropolitan size networks with high-speed requirements.},

  abstract = {Single photon detectors (SPDs) based on passively quenched avalanche
	photodiodes can be temporarily blinded by relatively bright light,
	of intensity less than 1 nW. A bright-light regime suitable for attacking
	a quantum key distribution system containing such detectors is described
	in this paper. In this regime, all SPDs in the receiver Bob are uniformly
	blinded by continuous illumination coming from the eavesdropper Eve.
	When Eve needs a certain detector in Bob to produce a click, she
	modifies the polarization (or other parameters used to encode quantum
	states) of the light she sends to Bob such that the target detector
	stops receiving light, while the other detector(s) continue to be
	illuminated. The target detector regains single photon sensitivity
	and, when Eve modifies the polarization again, produces a single
	click. Thus, Eve has full control of Bob and can perform a successful
	intercept-resend attack. To check the feasibility of the attack,
	three different models of passively quenched detectors have been
	tested. In the experiment, I have simulated the intensity diagrams
	the detectors would receive in a real QKD system under attack. Control
	parameters and side effects are considered. It appears that the attack
	could be practically possible.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the quantum key distribution (QKD) network
	designed and implemented by the European project SE cure CO mmunication
	based on Q uantum C ryptography (SECOQC) (2004-2008), unifying the
	efforts of 41 research and industrial organizations. The paper summarizes
	the SECOQC approach to QKD networks with a focus on the trusted repeater
	paradigm. It discusses the architecture and functionality of the
	SECOQC trusted repeater prototype, which has been put into operation
	in Vienna in 2008 and publicly demonstrated in the framework of a
	SECOQC QKD conference held from October 8 to 10, 2008. The demonstration
	involved one-time pad encrypted telephone communication, a secure
	(AES encryption protected) video-conference with all deployed nodes
	and a number of rerouting experiments, highlighting basic mechanisms
	of the SECOQC network functionality. The paper gives an overview
	of the eight point-to-point network links in the prototype and their
	underlying technology: three plug and play systems by id Quantique,
	a one way weak pulse system from Toshiba Research in the UK, a coherent
	one-way system by GAP Optique with the participation of id Quantique
	and the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology (formerly ARC), an entangled
	photons system by the University of Vienna and the AIT, a continuous-variables
	system by Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and
	THALES Research and Technology with the participation of Universit?
	Libre de Bruxelles, and a free space link by the Ludwig Maximillians
	University in Munich connecting two nodes situated in adjacent buildings
	(line of sight 80 m). The average link length is between 20 and 30
	km, the longest link being 83?km. The paper presents the architecture
	and functionality of the principal networking agent -the SECOQC node
	module , which enables the authentic classical communication required
	for key distillation, manages the generated key material, determines
	a communication path between any destinations in the network, and
	realizes end-to-end secure transport of key material between these
	destinations. The paper also illustrates the operation of the network
	in a number of typical exploitation regimes and gives an initial
	estimate of the network transmission capacity, defined as the maximum
	amount of key that can be exchanged, or alternatively the amount
	of information that can be transmitted with information theoretic
	security, between two arbitrary nodes.},

	crucial for security analysis. We propose a practical method, with
	only a beam splitter and a photodetector, to monitor the photon statistics
	of a QKD source. By implementing in a plug and play QKD system, we
	show that the method is highly practical. The final secure key rate
	is 52 bit/s, compared to 78 bit/s when the source is treated as a
	trusted source.},

	of two single photon detectors (SPD) in a quantum key distribution
	(QKD) system, has been proposed. In this paper, we propose another
	"time-shift" attack that exploits the same imperfection. In our attack,
	Eve shifts the arrival time of either the signal pulse or the synchronization
	pulse or both between Alice and Bob. In particular, in a QKD system
	where Bob employs time-multiplexing technique to detect both bit
	"0" and bit "1" with the same SPD, Eve, in some circumstances, could
	acquire full information on the final key without introducing any
	error. In addition, we prove that if Alice and Bob are unaware of
	our attack, the final key they share is insecure. We emphasize that
	our attack is simple and feasible with current technology. Finally,
	we discuss some counter measures against our and earlier attacks.},

	monitoring system is based on accumulating statistics of the times
	between consecutive detection events, and extracting the afterpulse
	and overall efficiency of the detectors in real-time using mathematical
	models fit to the measured data. We are able to directly observe
	changes in the afterpulse probabilities generated from the after-gate
	and faint after-gate attacks, as well as different timing signatures
	in the time-shift attack. We also discuss the applicability of our

  abstract = {In this paper so-called 'large pulse attack' is investigated. This
	attack is one of the possible methods of conventional optical eavesdropping,
	a new strategy of eavesdropping on quantum cryptosystems, which eliminates
	the need of immediate interaction with transmitted quantum states.
	It allows the eavesdropper to avoid inducing transmission errors
	that disclose her presence to the legal users. As an object of the
	eavesdropping, phase-state fibre optic schemes are considered. With
	large pulse attack, settings of transmitting and/ or receiving apparatus
	are interrogated by external high-power light pulses. Applicability
	conditions of this method are given. Type and amount of information
	learned by the eavesdropper is estimated, depending on parameters
	of the interrogating pulse and apparatus. An experimental set-up
	for an eavesdropping experiment is proposed and results of successful
	preliminary measurements are presented. It is concluded that additional
	protection is necessary for currently implemented quantum key distribution
	systems. The paper suggests several security measures against this
	kind of attack.},

	key distribution (QKD) with an untrusted source. A complete proof
	of its unconditional security is also presented. This scheme has
	significant advantages in real-life implementations as it does not
	require fast optical switching or a quantum random number generator.
	The essential idea is to use a beam splitter to split each input
	pulse. We show that we can characterize the source using a cross-estimate
	technique without active routing of each pulse. We have derived analytical
	expressions for the passive estimation scheme. Moreover, using simulations,
	we have considered four real-life imperfections: additional loss
	introduced by the 'plug&play' structure, inefficiency of the intensity
	monitor noise of the intensity monitor, and statistical fluctuation
	introduced by finite data size. Our simulation results show that
	the passive estimate of an untrusted source remains useful in practice,
	despite these four imperfections. Also, we have performed preliminary
	experiments, confirming the utility of our proposal in real-life
	applications. Our proposal makes it possible to implement the 'plug&play'
	QKD with the security guaranteed, while keeping the implementation
	practical.},

We offer a proof of this theorem and illustrate how quantum states can be teleported between two qubits.

We discuss how the private key distribution problem is dealt with using quantum key distributionquantum key distribution (QKD). The BB84BB84 and Ekert protocolEkert protocols are examples of the latter, and we review and illustrate their implementation.

abstract = {Return-to-Zero (RZ) and Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) Differential Phase Shift Keyed (DPSK) systems require cheap and optimal transmitters for widespread implementation. The authors report on a gain switched Discrete Mode (DM) laser that can be employed as a cost efficient transmitter in a 10.7 Gb/s RZ DPSK system and compare its performance to that of a gain switched Distributed Feed-Back (DFB) laser. Experimental results show that the gain switched DM laser readily provides error free performance and a receiver sensitivity of {\textminus}33.1 dBm in the 10.7 Gbit/s RZ DPSK system. The standard DFB laser on the other hand displays an error floor at 10{\textminus}1 in the same RZ DPSK system. The difference in performance, between the two types of gain switched transmitters, is analysed by investigating their linewidths. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the generation of a highly coherent gain switched pulse train which displays a spectral comb of approximately 13 sidebands spaced by the 10.7 GHz modulation frequency. The filtered side-bands are then employed as narrow linewidth Continuous Wave (CW) sources in a 10.7 Gb/s NRZ DPSK system.},

abstract = {The differential quantum efficiency (DQE) of a two-level homogeneously broadened injection laser is studied. It is shown that a simple analytic expression for the DQE provides an accurate approximation to the actual DQE over a wide range of parameters, and that this simple expression can be used to scale the output of an analytic model which assumes $\alpha$ $=$ 0 to predict accurately the output of a laser for $\alpha$ $\not=$ 0. The parameter $\alpha$ is a nonsaturating loss which decreases the DQE of the laser from unity. The results of this paper show that it is possible to extend the range of validity of the $\alpha$ $=$ 0 analytic model to regions where numerical analyses were only previously available.},
