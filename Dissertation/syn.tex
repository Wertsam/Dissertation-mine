\section*{Relevance}
Relevance of the chosen topic.
\section*{The goal}
(a scientific concept; a novel scientific idea that enriches a scientific concept, a new experimental method that helps determine new patterns in the studied phenomenon, increase the precision of measurements and find new ways to apply achieved results, etc.)\\

In order to achieve the goal in the framework of the thesis, the following objectives have been established:
\section*{Objectives}
\textbf{Objective 1: analysis and review}\\
(a comparison of the acquired results with previously available data related to the chosen topic)\\

\textbf{Objective 2: classification of research methods and experimental methods} \\
(a review of the applied pre-existing basic research methods, including quantitative methods, experimental methods, etc.)\\

\textbf{Objective 3: experimental design}\\
(modern methods of data collection and processing, a representative sample with an explanation of why these particular objects (units) and metrics were chosen, etc.) \\

\textbf{Objective 4: development of an experimental plant, panel, program, etc.}\\
(the results were received using certified equipment, the choice of the setup is explained, the reproducibility of research results in various conditions is presented, etc.)\\

\textbf{Objective 5: processing the experimental data }\\
(a comparison of the newly acquired and pre-existing data related to the chosen topic) \\

\textbf{Objective 6: providing recommendations for application and further research}\\
(a model for efficient application of experimental results, a system of practical recommendations, etc.)

\section*{Research methods}
In the framework of this thesis, the following research methods were used…\\
(an analysis of practical cases, an overview of the latest practices, etc.)

\section*{Assertions that are presented for defense}
(statements, ideas, arguments, proofs, theories, axioms, hypotheses, facts, phases, tendencies, stages, factors, conditions, etc.)

\section*{The novelty of research}
\textbf{Novelty of research 1: the main result that fulfills the chosen goal of the thesis}\\
(theories, lemmas, statements, methods that help learn more about the studied phenomenon and find new ways to apply the achieved results, etc.)\\

\textbf{Novelty of research 2:}\\
(manifestations of a theory: contradictions, inconsistencies; establishment of new problems, etc.) \\

\textbf{Novelty of research 3:}\\
(connections between the object and other phenomena, the genesis of the process, inner and outer contradictions, factors, cause-effect relationships, etc.)

\section*{The scientific and technical objective}
\section*{The research object}
\section*{The research subject}
(existing mathematical models, algorithms, quantitative methods that help receive new results in the framework of research, etc.)

\section*{The theoretical significance}
[for research object] (promising applications of new ideas in science and practice, the establishment of patterns, unknown connections, relations, etc.)

\section*{The practical significance}
(the limits and prospects of practical application of theory in practice, etc.)\\

(a model for efficient application of experimental results, a system of practical recommendations, etc.)

\section*{Definitions of new terms}
(new concepts, adjustments to older definitions, new terms, etc.)

\section*{The accuracy }
(known and verifiable data and facts, including marginal cases; the results correspond with the published experimental data on the thesis topic or in related fields, etc.)

\section*{Implementation of research results}
(specify the degree of implementation; technologies, new universal measurement methods, educational technologies, etc.)

\section*{Approbation of research results}
Key research results were presented and discussed at the following conferences:

\section*{Personal contribution of the author}
